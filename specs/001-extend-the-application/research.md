# Research: Book Data Models and API

**Feature**: Book collection management system with Django REST API  
**Date**: 2025-09-25  
**Research Status**: Complete

## Technology Decisions

### Django REST Framework Architecture
**Decision**: Use Django REST Framework with ViewSets and Serializers  
**Rationale**: 
- DRF provides robust API patterns with built-in authentication, permissions, pagination
- ViewSets offer automatic CRUD operations with minimal code
- Serializers handle validation and transformation automatically
- Integrates seamlessly with existing Django OAuth2 setup

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Raw Django views: Rejected due to repetitive boilerplate
- FastAPI migration: Rejected to maintain existing architecture consistency

### API Documentation with drf-spectacular
**Decision**: Use drf-spectacular for OpenAPI schema generation  
**Rationale**:
- Already specified in requirements for good operationIds, descriptions, and tags
- Provides automatic OpenAPI 3.1 schema generation from DRF serializers
- Integrates with Django's existing structure
- Supports customization of endpoint metadata

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual OpenAPI schema: Rejected due to maintenance overhead
- Django REST swagger: Deprecated in favor of drf-spectacular

### Data Model Relationships
**Decision**: Use foreign key relationships with junction table for user-book associations  
**Rationale**:
- Book → Author (ForeignKey): Multiple books can have same author
- UserBook junction table: Allows same book in multiple users' collections with different statuses
- Review → Book, User (ForeignKeys): Links reviews to specific books and users
- Genre as choices field: Fixed list of predefined genres reduces data inconsistency

**Alternatives considered**:
- Many-to-many direct relationship: Rejected because lacks reading status tracking
- Separate collections entity: Rejected as spec specifies single collection per user

### Genre Management Strategy
**Decision**: Use Django choices field with predefined genre list  
**Rationale**:
- Spec provides specific list of 25+ genres
- Choices field ensures data consistency and prevents typos
- Simplifies filtering and API responses
- Avoids unnecessary genre CRUD operations

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate Genre model: Rejected as genres are fixed and don't need CRUD
- Free-text genre field: Rejected due to data consistency concerns

### Reading Status State Management
**Decision**: Use Django choices with four predefined states  
**Rationale**:
- Clear state transitions: want_to_read → reading → finished/dropped
- Automatic timestamp tracking for status changes
- Enforces business rules through model validation
- Simplifies API filtering by status

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate status tracking table: Rejected as overkill for simple state tracking
- Boolean flags: Rejected as mutually exclusive states need single field

### Search Implementation Strategy
**Decision**: Django ORM with icontains lookups for text search  
**Rationale**:
- Simple implementation for MVP scope
- Covers title, author name, and description search
- No additional dependencies required
- SQLite compatible for current setup

**Alternatives considered**:
- PostgreSQL full-text search: Deferred until database migration needed
- Elasticsearch integration: Rejected as overkill for current scale

## Implementation Patterns

### Service Layer Architecture
**Decision**: Keep business logic in Django views for initial implementation  
**Rationale**:
- DRF ViewSets provide sufficient abstraction for current scope
- Premature abstraction avoided per constitution guidelines
- Can extract service layer if complexity grows

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate service classes: Deferred until business logic complexity justifies it

### Authentication Integration
**Decision**: Leverage existing DRF Token OAuth2 authentication setup 
**Rationale**:
- Project already has django-oauth-toolkit configured Token auth
- REST_FRAMEWORK settings already specify authentication classes
- Maintains consistency with existing API patterns
- Analyze settings.py to view current Django Request Framework settings

**Alternatives considered**:
- Session authentication: Insufficient for API usage
- JWT tokens: Unnecessary complexity given existing OAuth2 setup

### Auto-creation Logic for Authors
**Decision**: Implement get_or_create pattern in serializer  
**Rationale**:
- Simplifies API usage - users don't need to create authors separately
- Prevents duplicate authors with same name
- Maintains referential integrity

**Alternatives considered**:
- Require explicit author creation: Rejected for poor UX
- Allow duplicate authors: Rejected for data consistency

## Research Validation

### Constitution Compliance
- ✅ Django app isolation: Code generation within existing app structure
- ✅ Technology stack: Django 5.2+, Python 3.13+ as specified
- ✅ No test modification: Tests excluded from scope
- ✅ Gradual change: Single feature implementation with clear boundaries

### Technical Requirements Met
- ✅ Django REST Framework with drf-spectacular
- ✅ Multi-user support with separate collections
- ✅ Four reading statuses with automatic timestamps
- ✅ Foreign key relationships as specified
- ✅ Search and filtering capabilities
- ✅ Predefined genre list implementation
- ✅ Author auto-creation business logic

### Outstanding Considerations
- Performance optimization deferred until usage patterns established
- Database migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL deferred
- Advanced search features deferred until user feedback available
- Caching strategy deferred until performance requirements clarified
